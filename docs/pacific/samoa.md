## Enroute

There are no real-world Enroute Sectors operating above Samoa, however due to Samoa's complex Approach sectors and large TMAs, we merge them into a single Faleolo Control Sector.

* **NSFA_CTR**: "Faleolo Control" on 126.900. 
    * **Limits**: Vertical limits differ. Includes the main sector to the West, and the 'R' sector over Pago Pago.
        * The West Sector is from SFC to FL245. 
        * The East Sector is from 3,500ft to FL245.
    * The West Sector provides an Enroute Service for NSFA, and interfaces directly with NSFA.
    * The East Sector provides a TMA service to NSTU, but **does not** provide a Tower service, as the lower limit is 3,500ft. 

## Tower

* **NSFA_TWR** "Faleolo Tower" on 118.100
    * **Limits**: SFC to 7,500ft. Lateral bounds as shown above.
    * Provides a Procedural Approach service for NSFA. Also provides a control service for NSMA to the west.

## Pago Pago (NSTU)

NSTU (Pago Pago) is an interesting aerodrome. It is normally uncontrolled, with a combined App/Dep above it, starting at 3,500ft. On the network, this service is to be provided by NSFA_CTR. 

A tower position will be established on the network for NSTU, as an Event Only position on 122.900. While not incredibly accurate, it will be helpful when an event in underway in the area. The NSTU Clearance position will not be modelled.
