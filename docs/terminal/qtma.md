!!! note "Queenstown Procedures"
    The QTMA procedures build upon information already contained in the [NZQN Aerodrome Procedures](../aerodromes/Class-C/nzqn.md), and any Controller logged on to QTMA shall be familiar with those procedures.

## Positions

| Position Name   | Shortcode | Callsign             | Frequency | Login ID | Usage   |
| --------------- | --------- | -------------------- | --------- | -------- | ------- |
| Queenstown TMA  | QTMA      | Queensotown Approach | 125.750   | NZQN_APP | Primary |


## Airspace

The Queenstown CTA/C follows the lateral and vertical boundaries as shown below.

### Transfer of Control Points

| Transfer Flow       | Requirements                                                             | Notes                                                                                         |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Tower -> Approach   | Once the aircraft becomes airborne off the runway                        | Tower shall instruct all aircraft to contact ATMA airborne|
| Approach -> Control | Once the aircraft are approaching the lateral or vertical bounds of QTMA | Aircraft may also be handed off when clear of all conflicts, provided the next sector accepts the early handover.|
| Control -> Approach | Aircraft is approaching the vertical and lateral bounds of the TMA       | Aircraft may be handed off early, provided that QTMA is happy to accept. |
| Approach -> Tower   | Once established on approach, or within QN TWR's CTA/D.                  | Aircraft cleared for a visual approach may be cleared to contact sooner for separation against circuit traffic.|

## Departures

Departures shall be assigned in accordance with the [SID Assignment guide](../aerodromes/Class-C/nzqn.md#sid-assignment). 

QTMA may climb aircraft as necessary up to their RFL. International departures may be cleared up to a maximum of `FL250`, with further available when handed to STH.

### Track Shortening on SIDs


## Arrivals 

STH will hand aircraft to QTMA no lower than `FL180`, unless coordinated.

Aircraft shall be issued either the `RNP Y (AR)` or `RNP Z (AR)` approaches. If a non-standard approach is requested, such as the RNP F/G/H or VOR DME, coordination shall occur. This requires agreement from the ADC Controller and QTMA. 

Once in QTMA airspace arrivals may be descend to `FL150` and then `A100` to commence the approach or straight down to `A100` where traffic permits. 

**Note** Aircraft should not be track shortened on the STAR into Queenstown due to the high mountainous terrain.
