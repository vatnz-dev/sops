!!! note "Christchurch Procedures"
    The CTMA procedures build upon information already contained in the [NZCH Aerodrome Procedures](../aerodromes/Class-C/nzch.md), and any Controller logged on to CTMA shall be familiar with those procedures.

## Positions

| Position Name     | Shortcode | Callsign              | Frequency | Login ID | Usage     |
| ----------------- | --------- | --------------------- | --------- | -------- | --------- |
| Christchurch TMA  | CTMA      | Christchurch Approach | 126.100   | NZCH_APP | Primary   |


### Event Only Positions

!!! Danger
    The following are designated as Event Only positions, and may only be staffed during a VATNZ event where approved, or if explicitly authorised by the Operations Director.

| Position Name               | Shortcode | Callsign              | Frequency | Login ID | Usage                       |
| --------------------------- | --------- | --------------------- | --------- | -------- | --------------------------- |
| Christchurch Terminal Radar | CDEP      | Christchurch Approach | 120.900   | NZCH_DEP | Events - Traffic Management |

## Airspace

Christchurch CTA/C follows the lateral and vertical boundaries as shown below. CTMA has a vertical limit of `A095`.

### Transfer of Control Points

|Transfer Flow         | Requirements                                                  | Notes                                                                       | 
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | 
| Tower -> Approach    | Once the aircraft becomes airborne off the runway             | Tower shall instruct all aircraft to contact CTMA airborne                  |
| Approach -> Control  | Once the aircraft are approaching the lateral bounds          | Aircraft may be handed off when nothing further is required of the aircraft | 
| Control -> Approach  | Once the aircraft is approaching the cleared level by control | Aircraft may not always be cleared to A110 when handed to CTMA              | 
| Approach -> Tower    | Once established on final (ILS/LOC) or over the IAF (RNP)     |                                                                             |

## Departures

Departures shall be assigned in accordance with the [SID Assignment guide](../aerodromes/Class-C/nzch.md#sid-assignment). 

CTMA may climb departing aircraft as necessary to maintain separation and traffic flow up to their RFL. International departures may be instructed to climb to `FL250`, with further available on coordination from KAI or STH.

### Track Shortening on SIDs

Aircraft under the jurisdiction of CTMA may be track-shortened or assigned a heading to assist with sequencing or for separation. 

CTMA may track-shorten where practical within their sector.

Prior coordination or notification is not required for the following flights:

| Criteria to be met                                                                   | Clearance Limit                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
|Aircraft entering KAI at or above `A110` and DEST NS                                    | DCT `RIVTA`                             |
|Aircraft with a filed flight plan routing via GULOV and entering KAI at or above `A110` | DCT `GULOV`                             |

Aircraft entering STH at or above `A110` are to be routed via `PEHRR`, `IDARA`, `ELDAK`, `GUPUT`, `AVOCA`, `DAMPI`, `VETEV` or `ABAXO`.

### Assigned Heading Departures

Assigned heading deparures may be requested by Tower or CTMA in order to allow for a more efficient traffic flow from the runway. Assigned heading departures shall be issued in accordance with [NZCH - Assigned Headings for PEDMI departures](../aerodromes/Class-C/nzch.md#assigned-headings-for-pedmi-departures).

## Arrivals 

KAI or STH will hand aircraft to CTMA no lower than `A095`, unless coordinated otherwise. However, note that the standard descent level is `A110`.

### Short STARs

`BELEE #J` and `BELEE #K` are Short STARs into CH TMA that capture ILS 02 and ILS 20 at their intermediate fixes, `ALBAD` and `DIVSU` respectively. KAI and STH must co-ordinate with CH TMA before clearing aircraft for these arrivals, as prior planning may be required to ensure flow is maintained.

These STARs are flow control STARs, allowing controllers to sequence aircraft onto a shorter final approach. Controllers should utilise these STARs when a conflict exists at the IAF for the ILS 02/20 or if northbound or southbound arrival flows have already been established.

These arrivals provide track shortening of **4nm** compared to the `BELEE #A`/`BELEE #B` arrivals.

### Track Shortening on STARs

CTMA may make use of track-shortening on STARs to allow for an efficient sequence to be applied. Where an aircraft has been taken away from the STAR and are subsequently required to re-join and follow the STAR, the following RTF shall be used:

!!! hint "RTF for re-joining a STAR"
    **ATMA**: *New Zealand 677, track direct UPVES to re-join the STAR. Descend to 7000ft, radar terrain*.


## Uncontrolled IFR 

For uncontrolled IFR aircraft, if CTMA is the final controlling sector, CTMA shall issue the appropriate STAR for the destination aerodrome.

If the aircraft is terminating beneath the CTMA Control Area, they shall be instructed to contact you on the ground to cancel their IFR flight plan. If their flight is terminating beneath another sector, such as STH, they shall be instructed to contact that sector to terminate their FPL. This shall be coordinated with the appropriate sector.

!!! note "RTF for descent into uncontrolled airspace"
    **Situation**: An aircraft is flying from NZCH to NZTU, which sits under STH's boundaries.

    **CTMA:** *FIS, leave controlled airspace by descent, no reported traffic outside of controlled airspace, QNH 1011. On the ground contact Christchurch Control on 129.3 for IFR cancellation.*


## Coordination

### Christchurch Tower

CTMA shall coordinate with Christchurch Tower on any requested approach that is not nominated in the ATIS.

### KAI and STH

CTMA shall coordinate any track shortening outside of their control area.
