!!! note "Hamilton Procedures"
    The HTMA procedures build upon information already contained in the [NZHN Aerodrome Procedures](../aerodromes/Class-D/nzhn.md), and any Controller logged on to HTMA shall be familiar with those procedures.

## Positions

| Position Name     | Shortcode | Callsign              | Frequency | Login ID | Usage     |
| ----------------- | --------- | --------------------- | --------- | -------- | --------- |
| Hamilton TMA      | HTMA      | Bay Approach          | 125.300   | NZHN_APP | Secondary |

!!! note Hamilton TMA
    Controllers shall note that HTMA is a **secondary** position therefore BAY must be staffed before a controller may log on HTMA. 

## Airspace

Hamilton CTA/C follows the lateral and vertical boundaries as shown below. HTMA has a vertical limit of `A095`. Controllers shall be aware of which frequency to hand aircraft to, as shown on the image below.

|Transfer Flow         | Requirements                                                  | Notes                                                                       |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tower -> Approach    | Once the aircraft becomes airborne off the runway             | Tower shall instruct all aircraft to contact HTMA airborne                  |
| Approach -> Control  | Once the aircraft are approaching the lateral bounds          | Aircraft may be handed off when nothing further is required of the aircraft |
| Control -> Approach  | Once the aircraft is approaching the cleared level by control | Aircraft may not always be cleared to A110 when handed to HTMA              |
| Approach -> Tower    | Over the IAF (RNP) or established inbound on the VOR/DME      |                                                                             |

## Departures

HTMA may climb all domestic aircraft to their RFL.

## International

International Flights departing to the west via `UPLAR`, `MADEP` and `PEBLU` have a restriction of `A100` at `LEKUS`, this may be cancelled with coordination to RAN. All International departures may be climbed to FL250 by HTMA, with further climb from RAN.  

## Arrivals

 All arrivals will be handed to HTMA prior to A110. HTMA may track shorten as required.

 HTMA shall note the `RNP Z` is CAT A/B/C/D only. While the `RNP Y` is CAT A/B only.

## Coordination

HTMA shall coordinate any non-nominated approaches with HTWR. Any track shortening outside of HTMA's CTA shall be coordinated with the appropriate ENR sector.
