## Departures

Aircraft released to ATMA may be tracked direct to a fix or assigned a heading to aid with sequencing or for the benifit of the pilot. 

ATMA shall note that all Prop SIDs out of AA contain a hold down of `A050`. ATMA shall climb the aircraft as required. Note that not all pilots will be aware of this hold down, therefore if an aircraft is to be held down at `A050` the pilot shall be told to *"Climb to 5000"*. It shall also be noted that the `BROOK #Q` has a altitude restriction of between `A025` and `A040`. 

Aircraft must climb to `A030` on the extended runway centreline before turning North on departure. Aircraft may be turned South passing A005. 

ATMA may track aircraft direct to the following positions without coordintation to OCR, RAN and BAY. Any waypoint before or abeam NP in RAN including LAKAR. And other waypoints such as HN, TAPAT and BOGUN. 

### STAR Clearances 

ATMA is responsible for issuing STAR clearances for aircraft bound for Hamilton and Tauranga. With coordination to BAY and/or HTMA (if online) on the appropriate STAR. IFR Training is popular between AR and HN so if there are any special details of an aircraft or a specific request from the pilot this shall also be passed onto HTMA (or BAY if HTMA offline). 

### Assigned Headings 

As per [Assigned Headings](../aerodromes/Class-C/nzaa.md#assigned-headings) ATMA shall endevour to coordinate assigned headings with TAA as soon as practical. Assigned heading shall be issued in the instance that a departing aircraft will be taking off close to an arriving aircraft, or for track shortening. This heading ensures the missed approach path is clear for the arriving aircraft incase of a go-around. Controllers shall note that only aircraft departing to the South may be assigned a heading, as aircraft departing north may not turn until passing `A030` therefore an assigned heading becomes impractical. 


## Arrivals 

Aircraft recivced from OCR, RAN and BAY shall be assigned the standard level of `A110`, or at times aircraft may be assigned different levels depending on the traffic levels etc. 

Controllers are expected to be aware of the different STARs leading into AA, AR and WP and what STARs lead to what approach, therefore the following track shortening in low levels of traffic or for sequencing shall be applied. 

For track shortening aircraft may be tracked direct SABAV and GITUK for the ILS or ZORBA, ELBOP, and ATAMA for RNP-ARs.  Any International arrivals shall expect mininimal track shortening as due to the layout of the STARs. 

In relation to [Noise Abatement](../aerodromes/Class-C/nzaa.md#noise-abatement) Controllers shall also note that the RNAV (RNP) S, U, X  for all runways and the RNP Y RWY 23L are only available between 0700 and 2200 local. However the RNAV (RNP) Y RWY 05R is available H24. 

## Noise Abatment

For Noise Abatment refer to [Auckland Aerodrome Page](../aerodromes/Class-C/nzaa.md#noise-abatement)

## Uncontrolled IFR 

### Departures 

IFR aircraft on the ground shall call ATMA prior to taxi to obtain IFR clearance. After a correct readback shall be told to report at the holding point for validation of their IFR clearance, and are cleared to enter controlled airspace on a SID and are advised to report prior to entering controlled airspace (Will normally be `A025` out of both North Shore and Ardmore). 

### Arrivals

For arriving IFR aircraft, ATMA shall issue the most appropriate STAR, and shall ask what approach they are antcipating. ATMA shall clear aircraft to leave controlled airspace via an approach, and get them to report on the ground to terminate thier flight plan


## Coordination

### TAA

ATMA shall coordinated with TAA and OCR/RAN/BAY as seen fit including any request for the non-nominated approach. 

### OCR, RAN and BAY

ATMA shall coordinate any track shortening not stated in [Departures](../terminal/atma.md#departures).
