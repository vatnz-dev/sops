## Enroute Sectors

New Zealand's Airspace is split up into many sectors, mainly to help with traffic levels. This means that if you are flying from the top of the country to the bottom, you may speak to 3 or more controllers along the way, all with different frequencies.

!!! Info
    **Due to current limitations with VATSIM and our Controller clients, Enroute Controllers will only appear online over their primary sector. Please read their controller info to see if they are providing extended services**
