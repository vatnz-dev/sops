## Positions

| Sector Name   | Shortcode | Callsign         | Frequency | Login ID |
| ------------- | --------- | ---------------- | --------- | -------- |
| Oceanic Radar | OCR       | Auckland Control | 123.900   | NZAA_CTR |

## Airspace

OCR covers all airspace within the lateral bounds as found below. The lower limit for OCR is:

  - Within 100nm AA VOR: `A095`
  - Between 100 to 200nm AA VOR: `A135`

When **RAN**, **BAY** or **AA TMA** are offline, OCR automatically inherits and assumes all responsibility for those sectors.

## Sector Responsibilities

OCR is responsible for initial sequencing, issuing STAR clearances, and issuing an initial descent for aircraft bound for NZAA and NZWP. 

OCR is also responsible for the initial sequencing of aircraft on the `T46` airway between `NUTRA` and `ELKIG`.

BAY shall also manage the arrivals and departures into and out of any controlled or uncontrolled IFR aerodromes in its sector. This shall include issuing STARs and providing a top-down service where appropriate.

## Coordination

### Handovers

Aircraft shall be handed over as per the [Standard Coordination Procedures](../controller-skills/handover.md).

### AA TMA

OCR may issue STAR clearances to aircraft bound for any aerdrome within AA TMA without coordination, provided it is for the nominated runway and approach type as stated in the ATIS. A request for use of a non-nominated approach requires agreement from both the TMA and ADC Controller.

OCR may descend aircraft to `A110` without coordination from the AA TMA.

If a sequencing conflict is to occur, OCR shall coordinate with AA TMA as to an ideal arrival order. 

OCR may clear aircraft direct to the STAR's AA TMA boundary fix without coordination, provided that they have been cleared to rejoin the STAR at that point. Aircraft may be cleared to track direct to a fix within AA TMA's boundary with co-ordination, subject to the same condition.

!!! hint "RTF for rejoining a STAR"
    **OCR**: *New Zealand 677, track direct TAZEY to rejoin the STAR. When ready descend FL150*.

    **Note**: As `TAZEY` sits within AA TMA's airspace, co-ordination would be required.

### Oceanic

Oceanic-bound aircraft are required to cross the FIR boundary at their CFL and via a defined waypoint. 

OCR may clear Oceanic bound aircraft direct to their boundary crossing fix without coordination from ARO. If aircraft request an amendment to their RFL, this shall be coordinated with ARO.

OCR shall give ARO a **10 minute warning** of the aircraft's crossing of the FIR boundary.

### RAN and HN TMA

OCR may issue STAR clearances to aircraft bound for HN without co-ordination with HN TMA for the nominated runway and approach type as stated in the ATIS. A request for use of a non-nominated approach shall be made to RAN, who will advise the aircraft on first contact. OCR may not issue any track-shortening for aircraft into HN. 

OCR may descend HN bound traffic to `FL150` without coordination from RAN.

### NAK

OCR may clear any traffic bound for either `MOTKO`, `ELKIG` or `LAKAR` direct to that fix without coordination from NAK, provided that the aircraft is on course, and at CFL.
