## Coordination

### Oceanic

Oceanic-bound aircraft are required to cross the FIR boundary at their CFL and via a defined waypoint. 

KAI may clear Oceanic bound aircraft direct to their boundary crossing fix without coordination from ARO. If aircraft request an amendment to their RFL, this shall be coordinated with ARO.

KAI shall give ARO a **10 minute warning** of the aircraft's crossing of the FIR boundary.

When traffic crosses into KAI from NZCI, they shall be identified in the normal manner, and provided with a domestic squawk code. 

!!! hint "RTF for NZCI-bound traffic"
    Traffic bound for NZCI be advised that they will be uncontrolled, and that ARO is proving a limited monitoring service.

    Aircraft bound for NZCI typically remain at flight levels under the Lower Limit of Oceanic airspace, and shall be handed over to UNICOM when crossing the FIR boundary. BAY shall advise ARO in the same manner as a reqular Oceanic flight, as Oceanic will maintain a limited monitoring service.

    **KAI**: *Chathams 541, cleared to leave controlled airspace on crossing waypoint `BOUNDRY FIX`. Control services not available. Auckland Radio providing limited monitoring. Continue with UNICOM now on 122.800. Call Auckland Radio on the ground for IFR cancellation.*
