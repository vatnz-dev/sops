## Positions

| Sector Name                | Shortcode | Callsign     | Frequency | Login ID   |
| -------------------------- | --------- | ------------ | --------- | ---------- |
| Christchurch Control (Bay) | BAY       | Bay Approach | 119.500   | NZCH-B_CTR |

## Airspace

BAY covers all airspace within the lateral bounds as found below. The lower limit is `A065`, except surrounding NZTG and NZRO, where it drops to `A035`.

When HN TMA is offline, BAY automatically inherits and assumes all responsibility for that sector up to the lower limit of RAN airspace, which is `A110`.

When GS TWR is offline, BAY automatically inherits the TWR and Procedural Approach services provided by GS TWR. See [the responsibilities section on GS TWR](#gs-twr).

## Sector Responsibilities

BAY is responsible for managing the flow, sequence and initial descent of East Coast traffic into and out of the AA TMA. Additionally, BAY shall manage any traffic crossing into OHA to the South.

BAY shall also manage the arrivals and departures into and out of any controlled or uncontrolled IFR aerodromes in its sector. This shall include issuing STARs and providing a top-down service where appropriate.

!!! info
    In the real world, BAY is heavility utilised for contingency operations when RAN sector is unavailable, with main trunk traffic overflying Lake Taupo before being sequenced for the `NOBAR` STAR into NZAA.


### HN TMA

BAY also manages traffic into and out of HN TMA to the east. When HN TMA is offline, BAY automatically inherits HN TMA's airspace. When assumed, BAY also retains control of aircraft in the small segment of RAN airspace between the eastern boundary of HN TMA, and the western boundary of BAY.

### GS TWR

When GS TWR is offline, RAN is responsible for all functions of GS TWR, including the Procedural Tower service. 

When responsible for GS TWR, RAN may opt to provide a radar approach service, rather than a procedural approach service. 


## Coordination

### Oceanic

Oceanic-bound aircraft are required to cross the FIR boundary overhead a defined waypoint at their final flight level. BAY shall coordinate with ARO if an aircraft is unable.

BAY shall give ARO a **10 minute warning** of an aircrafts crossing of the FIR boundary.

### OHA

BAY shall ensure any aircraft crossing into OHA have been cleared to their RFL.  

BAY shall issue STARs to aircraft bound for NZPM and NZOH with coordination, and may descend OHA-bound aircraft to `FL190` without coordination.

### RAN

BAY shall issue STARs to aircraft bound for NZNP with coordination, and may descend these to `FL150` without coordination.

### AA TMA

BAY shall issue STAR clearances to aircraft bound for NZAA, NZAR or NZWP without coordination, provided it is for the nominated duty runway and approach type as stated in the ATIS. A request for use of a non-nominated approach (such as an RNP) requires agreement from both the TMA and ADC Controller.

BAY may descend aircraft to `A110` without coordination from AA TMA.

If a sequencing conflict is to occur, BAY shall coordinate with AA TMA as to an ideal arrival order. In the event that RAN and BAY sector traffic interfere, AA TMA shall decide the order of arrivals.

BAY shall ensure that IFR aircraft crossing into AA TMA bound for NZAA are established on the `NOBAR` STAR. BAY shall not issue track shortening beyond `NOBAR` except where required by AA TMA for sequencing.

### HN TMA

BAY shall issue NZHN-bound aircraft STAR clearances, and descend aircraft to `A080` without coordination from HN TMA. BAY may descend lower with coordination.

### GS TWR

BAY shall issue STAR clearances to all aircraft bound to NZGS from within the BAY sector. Should an aircraft be entering GS TWR from the South West, GS TWR shall coordinate sequencing.

BAY may descend aircraft to `A090` without coordination from GS TWR.

BAY may clear aircraft direct to `CREEK`, `WARIK`, `OTOKO` or `ELMER` with a heads-up coordination to GS TWR.

### NR TWR

BAY shall issue STAR clearances to aircraft bound for NZNR, and may descend these aircraft to `A090` without coordination from NR TWR.
