## Super Wake Turbulence Category

Aircraft that fall within the `J` or 'Super' Wake Turbulence Category **must** have the RTF "Super" appended to the callsign in every transmission.

At present, only one aircraft falls within this category - the Airbus A380 `(A388)`.

!!! example "RTF Example for a Super Aircraft"
    **Christchurch Approach**: *"Emirates 412 Super, continue descent via the STAR to 8,000 feet. Christchurch Information OSCAR is current."*  
    **UAE412**: *"Descend by the STAR to 8,000 feet. We have Information OSCAR. Emirates 412 Super."*
