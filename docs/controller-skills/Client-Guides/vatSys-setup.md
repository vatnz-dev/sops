Our vatSys dataset comes pre-loaded with everything a controller needs to get connected, and no external software is required to be updated or modified before the controller can log on to the VATSIM network.

!!! note
    While a Navigraph Subscription is not required, you can update your Nav-data by going to: `Settings > Navigraph > Link Navigraph Account`

### Plugins

Our vatSys dataset currently ships with one plugin, the VATNZ Standard Route Tool. You can find this under `Tools > Standard Route Tool`
