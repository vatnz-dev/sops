  title: Cycle 2312 (30 Nov)
---

--8<-- "includes/abbreviations.md"

While Cycle 2312 is usually the biggest update of the year, this has been exacerbated by the PBN changes on the East Coast of the North Island. All GS and NR airspace and procedures have been reviewed and amended, with 90% of all procedures being replaced. Across this cycle, this has resulted in 2,500 lines of code being removed, and 3,391 lines being added. 

!!! danger "Important Note for EuroScope Users"  
    EuroScope doesn't automatically enable new sectors of airspace, so users will need to manually enable these in the `Other Set > Display Set > ARTCC Low` dialog.

    The changes made to GS and NR towers have **not** been tested in EuroScope, and it is suggested that users use vatSys to control all Procedural Towers.
