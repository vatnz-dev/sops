A very small release this cycle, with no changes to aerodrome procedures!

## Data Changes

- The following Navaids have been disestablished:
    - `LX NDB` 

### Aerodrome

#### NZLX: Alexandra

- The Alexandra NDB, `LX NDB`, has been removed.

#### NZPM: Palmerston North

- DCL is now available at Palmerston North.

### Standard Routes

- `AAWR1` 23L Route has been fixed to read `Q470` rather than `H470` as the first segment

- Routes have been updated in the Standard Route Tool and [public route repository](https://github.com/vatnz-dev/std-rte-public){ target=blank }.

### Other Dataset Changes

- In real life, `NZDN` and `NZWP` have had their `A1` holding point relocated. This change has not yet been made in our dataset due to lack of support in the sim which is likely to cause confusion. This change will be revisited in a later AIRAC update.

- Hamilton Delivery (HN_DEL) was removed in AIRAC 2412. However, unfortunately, some remnants of the position were left in the Euroscope setup. The final remnants have now been removed.
