## Revision A

### ANR Updates

There aren't any changes in the ANR this cycle.

### Dataset Updates

- **fix**: RNP approaches now no longer appear in both the `RNP` and `RNP-AR` map layers - only the `RNP` layer. 
  - This also extends to each aerodrome's individual approach map layers.
- **fix**: (SFG) Removed Threshold fixes from RNP and RNP-AR approaches. This is now performed automatically by the SFG.
- **fix**: (SFG) Fixed a bug that meant that some `RNP` approaches weren't being rendered in the `RNP` layer, in addition to the Aerodrome folder's RNP map layers. These now show up.
