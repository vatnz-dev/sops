## Revision A

### Dataset Updates

- **fix**: Palmerston North Tower/Ground has been renamed to "Palmerston Tower/Ground".
- **fix**: `LUBS3C` renamed to `LUBS2C`. 
- **feat**: Small changes to our Sector export logic in support of a future update. Because of this, the `NSFA`, `NTTT`, `NZCM` and `NZZO` FIRs are no longer shown in the domestic dataset.

## Revision B

Fix relating to the NZOH Boundary in `ENR Sectors.xml`.

## Revision C

Re-release to ensure that the changes carry through.
