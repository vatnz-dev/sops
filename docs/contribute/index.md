The SOPs project aims to provide a set of high quality, easily accessible, and easily maintainable SOPs to the VATNZ Community, enabling both Controllers and Pilots to enjoy a standardized and realistic service.

This project is open-source, relying on Community contributions and support to help make these the best they can be. You don't have to have an in-depth knowledge of programming to contribute, as most of our pages are written in Markdown. Everything will be explained to you as we go.

## What are we needing?

On VATSIM, we have to draw the line between what's hyper-realistic and the practical limitations of the network. People use VATSIM for a wide range of reasons - some seek a realistic service, whereas some people might just want to add an extra dimension to an already enjoyable hobby. When contributing to these SOPs, it's important to keep this in mind and to cater to everybody on the network.

We draw the line at things like low-visibilty and noise-abatement operations - where there offer no real benefit in the virtual environment. In contrast, procedures for Code F aircraft should be added, as these can have an effect on Pilots and their aircraft.

## Before you start

It's important that you read all of the Contribution documentation before making any changes. These will ensure that your PR's are approved and merged quickly.

Additionally, we ask that you reach out to the Operations Team before opening a new PR for your addition. This ensures that your change is a welcome feature to the project.

!!! info "Discord"
    There is a channel on the VATNZ Discord dedicated to the discussion and management of the these SOPS, which is not open by default to the Community. If you wish you be added to this channel, please contact the Operations Team.
