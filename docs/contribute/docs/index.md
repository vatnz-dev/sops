The SOPs Project aims to provide a set of high quality, easily accessible, and easily maintainable SOPs to the VATNZ Community, enabling both Controllers and Pilots to enjoy a standardizes and realistic service within the virtual New Zealand FIR.

This project used the MkDocs Material platform, and is hosted on GitHub with Github Pages. An upside of doing this is that we can use GitHub's built-in issue tracking and rectification system, as well as ensuring that only approved data makes it onto the SOPs site.

## What we are aiming to replicate

We aren't looking to completely replicate real-world ATC services, as a lot of it is impractical on the network. In addition to this, different people use VATSIM for many different reasons - some seek a realistic experience, whereas others may just be looking to provide an extra dimension to their flight. It's important to keep this in mind, so that we can cater to everybody on the network.

Because of this, it's important to reach out to the SOPS team before you look at making any changes or additions to these SOPs. This ensures that your change is a welcome feature to the project.

## Discord

There is a channel on the VATNZ Discord dedicated to the discussion and management of the these SOPS, which is not open by default to the Community. If you wish you be added to this channel, please contact the Operations Team.
