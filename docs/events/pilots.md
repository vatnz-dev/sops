# World Flight 2025 Pilot Briefing

## Flight Planning

### Route Planning

To minimise delays and reroutes, all pilots should plan via the published World Flight routing available both [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kCiN5s6UqeG1zV1WlxVgYkfs_uukcv7zdlwaOWKiLlY) and as the preferred route in SimBrief.

Pilots planning other routings may find they have delays and/or rerouting to sequence them with the other traffic.

### Fuel Planning

Aircraft can expect and should plan for significant delays enroute. Pilots can expect to be subject to all ATC sequencing tools including speed control, vectors off-track, and/or holding. Additionally your planned cruise level may not be available, so plan fuel to take a lower cruise level.

It is recommended pilots load a minimum of 45 minutes of contingency/holding fuel.

### Departure Clearance

Digital Departure Clearances (DCL) is the preferred clearance mechanism using the client-based private chat function. See [Digital Departure Clearance Guide](#digital-departure-clearance-guide) for more information.

Pilots who cannot accept a DCL can request a voice clearance as detailed in the [Voice Clearance Guide](#voice-clearance-guide)

## Leg 1 - Sydney (YSSY) to Auckland (NZAA)

### Charts

All relevant charts are linked [in the VATNZ Event](https://www.vatnz.net/events/wf2501)

### Enroute

Auckland Radio will be providing a surveillance service on VHF for the event. Position reports and HF voice procedures will not be used.

### Star Clearance/Descent

Pilots will be issued a STAR clearance by Auckland Control prior to their top of descent.

All pilots can expect to be issued:

1. `ARADI 8A` for RWY 23L - ILS
2. `ARADI 7B` for RWY 05R - ILS

To ensure separation on descent, all pilots must plan their descent at M.78/280kts then follow all published speed restrictions on the STAR. The descent speed can be set in your VNAV Descent/DES page of your FMC.

### Approach

On first contact with Auckland Approach, pilots are asked to provide the following information:

- Callsign
- Current Altitude
- Assigned Altitude
- Any Speed or Heading assigned by the preceding controller
- ATIS Information and QNH

e.g. "Auckland Approach, ANZ123 FL142 descending 11,000, Speed 230kts, C 1010"

Pilots inbound to Auckland can expect either:

1. ILS (RWY 23L)
2. ILS (RWY 05R)

Aircraft must follow altitude and speed restrictions outlined on the STAR/Approach charts. If you are not able to, advise the Approach controller as soon as practical.

Once established on the LOC, pilots should report established. After which the Approach controller will direct you to contact Auckland Tower.
e.g. “Auckland Approach, ANZ123 established”

### Landing

On first contact with Auckland Tower, advise your callsign only. In response you will receive one of the following:

1. "ANZ123, Auckland Tower continue approach number XX"
2. "ANZ123, Auckland Tower, Runway XX, cleared to land"
3. "ANZ123, Auckland Tower continue approach number XX, Expect late landing clearance"

In case of a Go-Around expect to be diverted to Ohakea (NZOH). Refer to [Diversion From Auckland](#diversion-from-auckland) for more information for Ohakea.

Once landed, vacate the runway in accordance with the "Minimum Runway Occupancy" charts and contact ground as instructed by the chart on 121.900. All Heavy aircraft can expect the International Terminal and all Medium Aircraft can expect the Domestic Terminal.

## Leg 1a - Sydney (YSSY) to Ohakea (NZOH)

### Charts

### Diversion From Auckland

Due to the significant traffic flow through NZAA some pilots may be asked to divert to NZOH to relieve congestion or in the case of a go-around.

All go-arounds will be handed over to Auckland Approach who will coordinate whether the aircraft is diverting or not.

In the case of a diversion the pilot will be instructed to track direct to `ORIDI` then handed over to Christchurch Control.

Control will clear the aircraft to NZOH via `ORIDI Y666 IDULR`.

### Enroute

### Taxi

Report to ground when ready to taxi. You will Taxi via the snow to the end of the runway for departure.

## Additional Information

### Antarctic Operations

There are two significant issues flying into NZFX:

1. There are no publicly available charts for NZFX.
2. There are misalignments between the available navdata and the scenery for the runway at NZFX.

We have mitigated these to the best of our ability.

To simplify operations the only active runway will be RWY 33T.

Williams Tower (NZWD_APP) provides a surveillance approach service to Phoenix.

#### Headings

There are three ways of representing a heading in Antarctica. These are:

1. Magnetic - This is largely useless as due to the magnetic variation it swings widely causing you to fly a curved track if you were to follow it.
2. True - This points towards the true south pole at S090 E180. This is what all bearings/headings will be given in.
3. Grid - This is a way of getting around the issue of many directions being south. A map grid is overlayed over the south pole and "North" is defined as pointing along the prime meridian. This is what the phoenix runway is defined using, hence RWY 33T has a True bearing of 160T. You may see this as a small box in the top corner of your ND labeled "GRID".

We will be using True headings for all navigation. If your aircraft does not have a switch for true headings advise atc if you are requested to fly one and an alternate instruction will be issued.

The True headings below do not align with the grid headings used to define the runway. Additionally the Runway drawn onto your ND may not align with the scenery. The recommended scenery is correct.

#### Procedures

The procedures we have designed are defined below in a textual format. You will need to load these manually into your FMC if you wish to fly them.

##### Arrival - HEMVI4

Cross `JEHOO` at or above `FL245`. Track 188°T to `RAPPY`. Track 155°T to `HEMVI`. Cross `HEMVI` at or above 4300, MAX 230 KT.

##### Approach - RNP Rwy 33 TRUE

Cross `HEMVI` at or above 4300, MAX 230 KT. Track 162°T to `RW33T` VIA `JOBGU`, `HEALD`, and `ARDLY` (FAF). Cross `JOBGU` at or above 4300. Cross `ARDLY` at or above 2000.

Your final approach course is 162°T (303°M)

Missed Approach: Track 162T to 2000 turn RIGHT, track to `BRACT` MANDATORY 5000. Hold at `BRACT`, inbound 252T Left Hand Turns 1 Minute Legs MHA 5000.

## Digital Departure Clearance Guide

### What is a DCL?

A DCL is a departure clearance delivered using the VATSIM private messaging function. This is available at both NZAA and NZCH. The delivery by text reduces the frequency usage ensuring it is not overwhelmed.

### What does it provide to pilots?

Pilots receive a clearance which will look like the following example:

```
ANZ440

CLEARED 210300 NZCH

PDC DCL1 CLEARED TO NZCH OFF 23L VIA LEVRA2P

SQUAWK 5062

NEXT FREQ 121.9

ATIS A

TRANSITION: SEE SID ROUTE: AACH3

ALT: 320
```

### Readback

In New Zealand you do not readback DCLs. Ensure you are squawking the correct transponder code and contact the next station with your request, the current ATIS, and the QNH.

## Voice Clearance Guide

Voice clearances will be the alternative method for providing clearances when pilots are unable to receive PDCs. Voice clearances in New Zealand look like the following example:

"ANZ440, CLEARED CHRISTCHURCH 3, FLIGHT LEVEL 320, LEVRA 2P DEPARTURE IGBAT TRANSITION, SQUAWK 5062."

This needs to be readback in full to the delivery controller.

"CLEARED CHRISTCHURCH 3, FLIGHT LEVEL 320, LEVRA 2P DEPARTURE IGBAT TRANSITION, SQUAWK 5062; ANZ440."

The ATIS and QNH must be reported on your first contact with ATC.
