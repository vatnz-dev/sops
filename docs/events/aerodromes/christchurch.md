## Clearance Delivery

### Flight Plan Compliance

Ensure **all flight plans** are checked for compliance with the approved WF Route:

`PEHRR A338 JEHOO RAPPY HEMVI`

If an aircraft has filed an *incorrect* route and you need to give an amended clearance, this amendment must be specified in the DCL.

### World Flight Teams

[WorldFlight](https://www.worldflight.center/official-teams) Teams shall have `STS/STATE` added to their remarks, and `WF TEAM` added to their Global Ops Field, to ensure they receive priority.

### Runway Selection

Runway 02 operations are preferred as it provides improved airspace utilization for CTMA. These operations can occur with up to a 10 kt tailwind.

### DCL

DCLs will be in use by default, to avoid frequency congestion. DLV shall send a DCL to each aircraft as they connect, prioritising those who connected first.

## Surface Movement Control (Ground)

### Arrivals

All medium jets can expect to park at the Domestic Terminal, Romeo Apron, or Dakota Apron.

All heavy jets can expect to park at the International Terminal, Post Apron, or Antarctic Apron.

Overflow parking is available at the various ancillary aprons. Avoid using the Western Apron to eliminate runway crossings.

### Departures

All departures shall use holding point `A7` or `A2`. Aircraft shall be told to monitor tower prior to reaching the holding point.

Pushbacks shall be metered such that there are no more than five aircraft at the holding point.

## Aerodrome Control (Tower)

### Departure Spacing

Ensure that a minimum of **90 second** spacing is applied between subsequent departures from the same runway.
