## Positions

## Clearance Delivery

### Flight Plan Compliance

Ensure **all flight plans** are checked for compliance with the approved WF Route the `AACH1`:

`IGBAT H384 NP H252 NS Y288 IPRAK`

If an aircraft has filed an _incorrect_ route and you need to give an amended clearance, this amendment must be specified in the DCL.

### World Flight Teams

[WorldFlight](https://www.worldflight.center/official-teams) Teams shall have `STS/STATE` added to their remarks, and `WF TEAM` added to their Global Ops Field, to ensure they receive priority.

### Runway Selection

Runway 23L operations are preferred as it provides improved airspace utilization for ATMA. These operations can occur with up to a 10 kt tailwind.

### DCL

DCLs will be in use by default, to avoid frequency congestion. DLV shall send a DCL to each aircraft as they connect, prioritising those who connected first.

## Surface Movement Control (Ground)

### Arrivals

All medium jets can expect to park at the Domestic Terminal/Apron.

All heavy jets can expect to park at the International Terminal/Apron.

### Go Arounds

Go Arounds will be instructed to fly heading 180 then track to `ORIDI` and climb to `A040` and handed over to ADEP for onwards clearance to `NZOH` as there will not be sufficient capacity at `NZAA` for a second attempt.

!!! example "Go Arounds"

    **ANZ25**: "Going around"
    **Auckland Tower**: "ANZ25 Turn Right/Left heading 180 Climb 4000 ft. Track direct `ORIDI` contact Auckland Approach 129.600.

### Departure Spacing

Ensure that a minimum of **90 seconds** spacing is applied between subsequent departures from the same runway.

## Coordination

### AA ADC

#### Go Arounds

Go arounds should be instructed to contact ADEP once they have completed their initial turn.

### AA TMA

#### Go Arounds

ADEP shall coordinate the onwards clearance for aircraft who have gone around with ATMA and RAN.
Aircraft should be fitted back into the NZAA stream where possible without impacting the current sequence. Other aircraft should be diverted to NZOH.
