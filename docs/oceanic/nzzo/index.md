Auckland Radio is an oceanic control station that covers the entirely of the NZZO FIR from FL245 to FL600, except where intersected by the NZZC and NZCM FIRs. In the real-world, radar coverage over this large area over the ocean is not possible - therefore non-radar procedures are used to ensure the separation of aircraft.

## Positions

There are three approved positions that can be staffed within the NZZO FIR. 

| Callsign   | Position Name         | RTF Designator | Frequency                    | Notes               |
