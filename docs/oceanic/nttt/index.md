## Positions

| -------- | ------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------- | ----- |

## Tahiti

In the real-world, NTTT is operatated by the French, so there are some peculiarities in NTTT.

* Oceanic airspace (Class A) starts at FL195, instead of FL245 in NZZO.
* Outside of the Tower/Approach/Enroute CTAs, the NTTT FIR is Class E from FL045 to FL195. This means that - 
    * If you're flying IFR above FL045, you're required to grab an IFR clearance and separation from NTTT_FSS.
    * If you're flying VFR above FL045, you're entitled to a traffic information service.
    * If you're above FL045 within NTTT_CTR's 200nm arc, this service is provided by NTTT_CTR.
* Outside of the Tower/Approach/Enroute CTAs, and between SFC and FL045, you're flying in Class G.

### FSS

* **NTTT_FSS**: "Tahiti Control" on 9.116 (aliased as 125.500)
    * Other RW frequencies: 3.467, 5.643, 8.867, 13.261, 17.904 (SELCAL), 5680 (no SELCAL).
    * Provides an Oceanic FSS service above FL195.
    * Provides a Class E IFR and Traffic service to aircraft above FL045, outside of any other CTA airspace such as Tower/Approach/Enroute.
