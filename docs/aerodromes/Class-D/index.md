  title: Class D 

---

Class D airspace normally applies to CTRs and CTAs surrounding regional aerodromes, such as Rotorua and Nelson.

IFR aircraft are separated from other IFR aircraft, but VFR aircraft are not separated from any IFR or other VFR aircraft. Within a CTR only, during special VFR conditions, IFR aircraft are separated from special VFR aircraft, and pecial VFR aircraft are separated from other special VFR aircraft when visibility is less than 5 km.

Pilots of VFR and IFR aircraft operating within Class D airspace must use a good lookout to separate themselves from each other as ATC separation is not provided.
