## Clearances

IFR clearances shall be issued as per normal. International Aircraft to the West should be cleared via `POKOM` or `AA VOR` to the North

VFR traffic shall be issued one of the published VFR Departures and may be issued plain language in low levels of traffic. Controllers shall note there are specific Helicopter Procedures.

## Ground Movements

No aircraft should require pushback. However a start clearance is still required for IFR traffic. 

For aircraft parked on the Eastern Apron, they shall be cleared to backtrack (if required) on 18L. 

Aircraft parked on the Western Apron (this should usually only apply to GA aircraft) should call prior to enterting the manouvering area. Note the `D1/2/3` holds shall be treated as a crossing given the proximity to `18R/36L`. Aicraft may backtrack `18L/36R` via `D` or taxi via `C` to `G1` as required.
