  title: Class C

--8<-- "includes/abbreviations.md"


Class C airspace is applied to CTRs at large
international aerodromes, associated CTAs,
and enâ€‘route airspace covering principal
domestic air routes.

In this airspace IFR and
VFR traffic are separated from each other at all
times. Within a CTR, IFR aircraft are separated
from special VFR (operating below visual
meteorological conditions) aircraft, and special
VFR aircraft are separated from each other
when visibility is less than 5 km.

Where separation is not being provided,
air traffic controllers are required to pass
appropriate traffic information to VFR aircraft
about other VFR aircraft, or special VFR aircraft
when visibility is less than 5 km. VFR aircraft,
however, must maintain their own separation
from each other.

All aircraft require an ATC clearance to be in
Class C airspace.
