### Transfer of Control Points

| Transfer Flow       | Requirements                                                                             | Notes                                                                                    |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Delivery -> Ground  | Once PDC has been issued either through Voice or DCL.                                    | This is only effective if Ground is online otherwise the aircraft is transfered to Tower | 
| Ground -> Tower     | Prior to arriving at their assigned hold, once clear of other traffic.                   | This is only effective if Ground is online                                               |
| Tower -> Approach   | For airline traffic, when airborne. For GA, when leaving the zone, if applicable.        |                                                                                          |
| Approach -> Tower   | When established on an instrument final, or if on an RNP approach, overhead the IAF.     |  
| Tower -> Ground     | Once clear of the active runway.                                                         | This is only effective if Ground is online otherwise aircraft remain with Tower          |                                                                                        |

## Clearance Delivery

Clearances shall be issued by Queewnstown Delivery (if online) and may be given via DCL or voice.

## Ground 

The following only applies if Ground is online, otherwise these operations will be managed by the Tower. 

### Pushback

Pushback and start up clearances are managed by the Ground Controller. For pushbacks on apron areas the phraseology “Push your discretion” is used to indicate that the pushback
is contained within an uncontrolled portion of the movement area and that ATC may not be aware of all apron activity.

### Taxiing

If Ground is online taxi instructions will be issued by them, otherwise it is delegated to Tower.  

### Use of Holding Points 

|  Runway 23 | Runway 05  |
| :--------: | :--------: |
|    `A4`    |    `A3`    |
 

!!! note
    These assignemnts are in place to ensure departing aircraft can backtrack and line up simultaneously to arriving aircraft backtracking and vacating the active runway, increasing the overall efficieny of airfield movements.

If `14/32` is to be used for light aircraft, then holding points are to be used as required or if specifically requested by the pilot. 

## Tower

The Tower Controller is responsible for all arrivals and departures, plus any VFR aircraft operating within the QN CTR/C. 

Unless established within the aerodrome circuit, Tower must ensure that no VFR aircraft are present within the Instrument Sector when an aircraft is beyond the FAP of the active approach procedure. VFR aircraft are not authorised to operate under any approach path, or within 3nm laterally of the approach path.

Aircraft that have been cleared to operate in accordance with the Northbound or Southbound visual procedures are deemed to be separated from IFR arrivals on the RNP (AR) approaches, as these run East and West.

## Departures

Aircraft departures shall be managed in-line with the [Runway Operations section](../../controller-skills/seperation#runway-operations).

### Helicopters

Helicopter operations are very frequent within Queenstown CTR/C, usually operating outside Tower's airspace but must be managed with care. 

!!! warning
    A reminder that Queenstown Tower must ensure that no VFR aircraft are present within the Instrument Sector when an aircraft is beyond the FAP of the active approach procedure.
