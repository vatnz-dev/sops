## Clearance Delivery

Clearances shall be issued by the Delivery position, and may be given via DCL or voice.

## Ground

### Pushback

Pushback and start up clearances are managed by the Ground Controller. For pushbacks on apron areas the phraseology “Pushback at your discretion” is used to indicate that the pushback
is contained within an uncontrolled portion of the movement area and that ATC may not be aware of all apron activity.

#### Night Pushback Operations

Wellington has two marked pushback holding zones, `Z1` & `Z2`. These zones are used during busy periods or at night to avoid blocking entry and exit points to the rest of the apron.
