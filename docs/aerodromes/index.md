  title: Overview

This section covers aerodrome specific procedures, separated by airspace class.

## Class C

Class C airspace is applied to CTRs at large international aerodromes, associated CTAs, and en‑route airspace covering principal domestic air routes.

In this airspace IFR and VFR traffic are separated from each other at all times. Within a CTR, IFR aircraft are separated from special VFR (operating below visual meteorological conditions) aircraft, and special VFR aircraft are  eparated from each other when visibility is less than 5 km.

Where separation is not being provided, air traffic controllers are required to pass appropriate traffic information to VFR aircraft about other VFR aircraft, or special VFR aircraft when visibility is less than 5 km. VFR aircraft, however, must maintain their own separation from each other.

All aircraft require an ATC clearance to be in Class C airspace.

## Class D

Class D airspace normally applies to CTRs and CTAs surrounding regional aerodromes, such as Rotorua and Nelson.

IFR aircraft are separated from other IFR aircraft, but VFR aircraft are not separated from any IFR or other VFR aircraft. Within a CTR only, during special VFR conditions, IFR aircraft are separated from special VFR aircraft, and special VFR aircraft are separated from other special VFR aircraft when visibility is less than 5 km.

Pilots of VFR and IFR aircraft operating within Class D airspace must use a good lookout to separate themselves from each other as ATC separation is not provided. 

## Tier 2 (Procedural Tower) Positions 

As per the [VATSIM Global Controller Administration Policy](https://vatsim.net/docs/policy/global-controller-administration-policy), the positions within VATNZ FIRs that are of a procedural nature fall under the Tier 2 Designation. In order to staff these positions, VATNZ controllers must undergo a Procedural Tower endorsement through the training department. More information on this course can be found on the [VATNZ Webiste](https://www.vatnz.net/training/courses/procedural-tower/)

Our procedural Aerodromes are: Gisborne (NZGS), Napier (NZNR), New Plymouth (NZNP), Nelson (NZNS), Dunedin (NZDN) and Invercargill (NZNV) These aerodromes are all Class D, therefore Class D airspace rules apply to these aerodromes.
