The NZZC and COD datasets are designed so that all necessary data is contained within the dataset files (<code>Airspace.xml</code>), and will refer to the Navigraph dataset if that data isn't present as a fallback. This ensures that Navigraph is not a pre-requisite for using vatSys.</p> <p>For the NZZC dataset, the locally-defined data reference is sourced from the New Zealand Air Navigation Register. For the COD dataset, the locally-defined data reference is sourced from Navigraph. This is due to VATNZ's airspace spanning multiple FIRs, with consolidating that information manually being a difficult task. </p> <p>The reference Navigraph dataset that was installed in the test environment was a much older version, sitting at Cycle 2304. Therefore, if procedures were referencing a waypoint that had been removed in a subsequent cycle, vatSys would fall back to the Navigraph dataset and resolve that waypoint. </p> <p>As the COD dataset can only be updated after the latest cycle release from Navigraph, work on the COD dataset began not long after Cycle 2406 was released. After the Navigraph data was updated the previously available fallback values were no longer present, causing the application to produce alarms.</p> <p>Going forward, our pre-release testing will be run in a clean vatSys environment, ensuring that we have the most recent data possible. Whilst not completely mitigating the potential for erroneous data, it is the most pragmatic solution.</p>"},{"location":"changelog/2024/2408/","title":"Cycle 2408 (08 Aug)","text":"<p>This cycle is a minor release, with a small number of changes.
